\section{Introduction}

The first goal of this lab was to learn about 'fringes.' We first explored how diffraction theory applies to an actual radio interferometer, and what the resulting fringe looks like in terms of its amplitude and phase. Once we obtained the fringe, we explored its properties further by taking a Fourier transform and Fourier filtering the fringe. We practiced these techniques on data taken of the Sun, and then we also obtained data of the Moon and a point source- W43 in our case. The other main goal of this lab was to expand on our knowledge of least-squares fitting techniques, specifically learning how to do \textit{nonlinear} least-squares fitting. Finally, we explored the Fourier transform relationship between interferometer response and sky brightness by using nonlinear least-squares fitting to obtain accurate diameters for the Sun and Moon.

\section{Experimental Setup}

All data collection for this lab was done with a multiplying interferometer.  The interferometer consists of two receiver dishes, each with a series of filters and mixers, as shown in \autoref{fig:interf}.  The received signal goes through a low power amplifier, a bandpass filter, a low noise amplifier, and a mixer within the feed of the dish. The signal is then brought into the lab where it goes through second bandpass filter, the second mixer, and a third bandpass filter. Finally the two signals from each side are mixed together in a DSB mixer.

An interferometer is desired over a single radio antenna because of increased angular resolution. Whereas the angular resolution of a single antenna with diameter \textit{D} is proportional to $\lambda/D$, the angular resolution achieved by two dishes separated by a baseline \textit{B} is proportional to $\lambda/B$. Consequently, the farther the two dishes are separated, the better the angular resolution.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{fig:interf}
     \end{center}
    \end{figure}
\newpage

The output of the interferometer is a sinusoidal-like signal called the "fringe."  Given a known baseline \textit{$B_y$} and the frequency, phase, and amplitude properties of the fringe, we can measure the declination of a point source as well as the diameters of the Sun and Moon. Exactly how will be discussed in later sections.

\subsection{Data Collection}
I wrote a script to take interferometry data, which uses the IDL procedures \texttt{isun} or \texttt{imoon} to calculate an altitude and azimuth for the object of interest. Additionally, I wrote a separate script which calculates these values using rotation matrices and double checked that each script gave the same outputs. Right ascension and declination values for the point sources came from the J2000 equinox, and therefore needed to be precessed to the current equinox. These values were then converted to local altitude and azimuth values using the local sidereal time (LST) and Campbell Hall's latitude and longitude. 
The tracking script updates the values every 10 seconds, using the \texttt{point2} command to set the orientation of the dishes. It also re-calibrates the dishes about every hour using the \texttt{homer} command, in case the dishes lose alignment.

\subsection{Choice of Mixing Frequency}

Initially, each lab group was to chose an L.O. frequency of 11.3,11.5,11.7,11.9,12.1, and 12.3 GHz. My group's initial Sun data was taken with the first L.O. frequency set to 12.3GHz. However, we later realized when looking at the initial filter with a passband of 10-18 GHz, that the maximum frequency we should have been using was 11.7GHz. This is because the later bandpass filter narrowly selects for 1.7 GHz, meaning that the frequencies we are actually recording from the sky are L.O.1 $\pm$ 1.7 GHz. Therefore, for any L.O. frequency above 11.7 GHz, such as 12.3 GHz, both frequencies are within the passband (in this case 10.6 GHz and 14 GHz). Choosing an L.O.1 of 11.3 GHz however, would mean that we would see 9.6 GHz and 13 GHz. However, the 9.6 GHz component would have been filtered out by the first bandpass filter, leaving only the 13 GHz component.

\subsection{Dish Accuracy}

When tracking the Sun, we attempted to visually confirm that the dishes were pointing directly at the Sun by checking that the feed shadow lined up directly with the center of the dish. In reality, the shadows did not line up perfectly, but were generally 1-3cm way from the center. Given a 1 meter distance from the feed to the dish, this means that the the dishes were up to 1.7\degree off from the desired position. For extended sources such as the sun, this offset can reduce the fringe amplitude but otherwise has no huge effects. For point sources, however, this offset reduces the chances of pointing directly at the object, and possibly prevents the dishes from pointing at the object at all. Additionally, we noticed that sometimes the wind atop Campbell Hall was strong enough to shake the dishes by several degrees, reducing the accuracy even further.

\section{The Fringe}
Because we use two different dishes separated by baseline \textit{$B_y$}, there is a difference in their distances from the source. This difference is distance is made up of the geometrical path delay $\tau_{g}$ as well as any difference in cable length $\tau_{c}$. We know $\tau_{g}$, which is a function of the hour angle of the source ($h_s$), from the geometry of the interferometer. For the east-west baseline we have:

\singlespacing
\begin{eqnarray}
 \tau_{g}(h_s) =\bigg[ \frac{B_y}{c}cos\;\delta \bigg] sin\;h_s
\end{eqnarray}

Therefore, the voltages for the two telescopes looking at a monochromatic source are: 

%\singlespacing
\begin{eqnarray}
 E_1(t) =cos(2\pi\nu t) \\
 E_2(t) =cos(2\pi\nu \big[ t+\tau_{tot}\big])
\end{eqnarray}
%\doublespacing

and the product is the interferometer fringe output:

\begin{eqnarray}
 F(t) =cos(2\pi\nu t) cos(2\pi\nu \big[ t+\tau_{tot}\big])
\end{eqnarray}
\doublespacing
Using various trig identities and the fact that $\frac{\nu}{c} = \lambda$ (see handout for each individual step) we are left with the fringe amplitude for a point source:


\begin{eqnarray}
 F(h_s) =Acos\bigg[ 2\pi(\frac{B_y}{c}cos\;\delta)sin\;h_s \bigg] -Bsin\bigg[ 2\pi(\frac{B_y}{c}cos\;\delta)sin\;h_s \bigg]
\label{eq:lss}
\end{eqnarray}

where  $A = cos(2\pi\nu\tau_c)$ and $B = sin(2\pi\nu\tau_c)$. Looking at the argument inside the cosine and sine in each term, we see a constant $C = \bigg[2\pi( \frac{B_y}{c}cos\;\delta )\bigg]$ multiplied by $sin(h_s)$. Because $h_s$ is the hour angle and increases monotonically with time, we can regard it as time. Therefore, the product $C sin(h_s)$ is the argument of the cosine terms and makes it oscillate with a with a frequency that depends on time. 

If you expand the hour angle term $sin(h_s)$ into a Taylor series, and consider that $F(h)$ varies as $f_f \;\Delta h$, you end up with a local fringe frequency of:

\begin{eqnarray}
f_f = \frac{C}{2\pi}cos(h_s)= \bigg(\frac{B_y}{\lambda}cos\delta \bigg) cos(h_s)
\label{eq:ff}
\end{eqnarray}
This value is in cycles per radian on the sky. To convert into cycles per minute, you must multiply by $\frac{2\pi}{60\times24}$ and to get cycles per second by $\frac{2\pi}{60\times60\times24}$.

\section{The Sun}
 
We began by taking fringe data of the Sun. \autoref{fig:fringe} shows the Sun fringe data with all 9 hours of data gathered as well as a zoomed in version.

        \caption{Sun Fringe Data. Subfigure (a) contains the entire 9 hours of data taken, and subfigure (b) shows a zoomed in version to highlight the sinusoidal nature of the fringe pattern.}\label{fig:fringe}
\end{figure}


A valuable exercise was to use the above 'local fringe frequency' equation to predict what frequencies we would see in the sun data, and then to confirm this by taking a Fourier transform of the Sun data. I performed the following calculations only on the first three hour chunk of sun data for simplicity (and because while we were observing the sun later, there was an attempt by another group to control the dishes and this might have corrupted the data). Our first set of Sun data was taken between the hour angles of -3 and 0. Therefore, the values of $cos(h_s)$ should range from $cos(-3\times 15)$ to $cos(0)$, or .707-1. Therefore, given a $B_y$ of 1524 cm and a $\lambda$ of 2.83 cm, a declination of $\lambda\approx0$ since this data was taken almost at the equinox, and substituting into \autoref{eq:ff} we expect to see a range of frequencies from .0277Hz to .0392Hz.

Indeed, taking the Fourier transform of the Sun fringe data results in \autoref{fig:sun_dft}, which shows that there are frequency components roughly between .027 and .039Hz. The reason there is more power at the higher end (.039Hz) is because this is the so-called 'transit' frequency, when the Sun is directly overhead, and spends a longer time at this frequency.

\section{Non-Linear Least Squares Fitting}

The least-squares fitting technique was used on \autoref{eq:lss}, and was done as follows. First we treat the entire value of $\bigg[ \frac{B_y}{\lambda}cos\;\delta \bigg]$ as an unknown, \textit{C}, and adopt a value for the right ascension $\alpha$ to compute $h_s$. Given these assumptions, we use the standard least-squares process to solve for the values of \textit{A} and \textit{B}. The least-squares process we used was the \texttt{CURVEFIT} function in IDL. We then sweep through different values of C and save the value of the sum of the residuals squared for each value. The value of C that gives the minimum sum-of-squares is the best value of C. The code that performed this is given below. 

\lstset{basicstyle=\footnotesize}


\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
;the function called 'fringe' is F = A[0]*cos(C*sin(x)) - A[1]*sin(C*sin(x))
;the 'answer' F is the array of voltage values gathered
F = volts
;here we calculate the hour angle
X = lst - ra ; hour angle is lst-ra
X = X*15*(!dpi/180.0) ; make it into radians
;make a blank array that has two values (A and B in our case)
pointz = make_array(2, stopval-startval, /double)
startval = 3000l
stopval = 5000l
A = [0.5, 0.5] ;initial guess for A
for jj=startval, stopval-1 do begin ; sweep through different values of C
      common share, c
      c = jj
      fit = CURVEFIT(X, F, weights, A, function_name = 'fringe', /noderivative, CHISQ=ressq)
      print,jj
      pointz[0,jj-startval] = jj ;assign value of C to the 1st elem in the array
      pointz[1,jj-startval] = ressq ; assign the sum of the squares of residuals to 2nd elem

\end{lstlisting}

This is the so-called 'brute-force' technique using least-sqaures. There is a more elegant way of computing the ****TODO*** but only gives local minima, have to put the initial guess so close to the real answer.

In addition we solve for $C = \bigg[2\pi( \frac{B_y}{c}cos\;\delta )\bigg]$ rather than simply $cos\;\delta$ because if we use a baseline that is too small in the solution, the best value for $cos\;\delta$ maybe larger than unity- meaning that no declination will give a satisfactory solution! INstead we solve for C and derive the declination from that value.

We then plot the values of the sum-of-squares versus the value of $C$ in \autoref{fig:ls_sun}. The lowest minimum in the resulting plot is at $C=3354$. Since $C = \bigg[2\pi( \frac{B_y}{c}cos\;\delta )\bigg]$, we can calculate backwards and find that $cos\; \delta = .9915$, which is extremely close to our expected value of $cos\;\delta=.9983$. This expected value comes from looking up the declination of the sun on March 12 here: http://www.wsanford.com/\~{}wsanford/exo/sundials/DEC\_Sun.html.

\section{The Moon}

The same process was repeated for the Moon. Unfortunately, our group did not collect any good Moon data, so Team BADWOLF was kind enough to let us use their raw Moon data. \autoref{fig:moon} is a plot of raw Moon data versus hour angle (calculated by LST-RA).

     \end{center}
    \end{figure}

\autoref{fig:moon_dft} shows the Fourier transform of the Moon Data. Using \autoref{eq:ff} again and given $\lambda=3 cm$ and $\delta \approx 17^\circ$, we can calculate that the expected values of $f_f$ for hour angles of -4 to 0 is .0177 Hz to .0353 Hz. There is a significant bump within that range, again with more power at the upper frequency value, since that corresponds to the transit frequency. It is not quite as well-defined as the Sun data, but very close.

%In order to check that our picosampler is set to the correct voltage threshold, we plotted a histogram of the data using the built in IDL function \texttt{histogram}. In \autoref{fig:histplots}, the histograms of the data gathered with the picosampler threshold set to 1V and 100mV are compared. 100mV is clearly the better choice since the data is not too quantized (as in the first plot) and looks like the well known Gaussian function.

%\subsection{Finding the Shape of the HI Line}
%
%We took data with two different mixing frequencies to obtain our 'online' and 'offline' spectra. We chose 1229.4 and 1231.4 as the two different initial LO frequencies in order to place the line in the middle of the upper sideband and the middle of the lower sideband, respectively. In \autoref{fig:avgplots} the effects of averaging the 'online' spectra and taking the median of the 'online' spectra are compared, along with the effects of smoothing the spectrum in the third plot.
%

%     \end{center}
%    \end{figure}

%    
%\newpage    
%    
%For comparison, the 'offline' spectrum is shown in \autoref{fig:offline}.

%    \label{fig:offline}
%     \end{center}
%    \end{figure}
%    
%    
%Once we have both the online and offline spectra, we can remove the instrumental bandpass to get the shape of the line by taking the ratio of the two. The ratios of $s_{online}/s_{offline}$ and  $s_{offline}/s_{online}$ are seen in \autoref{fig:ratio}.

%     \end{center}
%    \end{figure}
%    
% \subsection{Calibrating for Intensity}
% 
% In order to get the line intensity in terms of the calibration noise source, we took data with the horn looking at a cold sky, giving us $s_{coldsky}$ and with a human (Mahrud) acting as a blackbody to give us a spectrum, $s_{300K}$. We can obtain the scaling factor $T_{sys}$ by the following equation:
% 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%T_{sys} = \frac{\sum s_{coldsky}}{\sum (s_{300K}-s_{coldsky})}*T_{cal}
%\end{eqnarray}
%   
%Where $T_{cal}$ = 300K because that is the thermal power we injected by having Mahrud stand in front of the horn. Our calculated value for $T_{sys}$ is 266.4K.
%
%The final calibrated spectrum is given by $ratio \times T_{sys}$. The plot in \autoref{fig:finalcal} was obtained by taking the spectra of each ratio and averaging them, then plotting vs RF frequency.

%    \end{figure}
%\newpage
%   
%\subsection{Corrections for Doppler Velocity}    
%    
%In addition, I have plotted the final calibrated spectrum vs Doppler Velocity. The velocity values were calculated based on the Doppler formula:
%    
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \frac{v}{c} =- \frac{\Delta f}{f_{0}}
%\end{eqnarray}   
%

%    \label{fig:finalcalvel}
%     \end{center}
%    \end{figure}
%   
% Finally, we need to correct the observed velocity for the orbital velocity and spin of the Earth. Here we have used the \texttt{ugdoppler.pro} procedure to correct the velocities and express them with respect to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) and the Barycentric (Sun) reference frames. In \autoref{fig:corrvel}, the velocity with respect to the Barycentric frame is above and the LSR frame is below. Note, they only differ by a few km/s. The values have been calculated using the following values.

%\section{VSWR Measurement}
%When transferring power using electromagnetic waves moving through a medium such as cables or waveguides, it is not necessarily the case that all of the input power is transmitted when there is a change in medium. In real systems, if the impedance is different on either side, part of the power is reflected back towards the source. This condition is known as impedance mismatch. 
%The voltage reflection coefficient for a load with resistance $R_L$ that terminates a line with impedance $Z_0$ is 
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\rho = \frac{V_R}{V_F}=\frac{R_L - Z_0}{R_L+Z_0}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%Where $V_R$ is the reflected voltage amplitude and $V_F$ the forward one. The reflected voltage will interfere with the forward wave constructively and destructively, creating peaks and valleys in the voltage at different distances on the first medium.  The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio, or VSWR, is the ratio of $V_{max}$, the maximum voltage created by constructive interference, over $V_{min}$, the minimum voltage created by destructive interference throughout the medium:
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%VSWR = \frac{|V_{max}|}{|V_{min}|}=\frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%
%\subsection{Standing Waves in Coax Cable}
%
%One of the most effective methods of transmitting radio frequency signals is via coaxial cables. In a coax cable a conductive outer layer is grounded and wrapped around the signal carrying core with a dielectric insulator between the core and the shield. The advantage of this design is that electric and magnetic fields are confined to the dielectric with little leakage. In addition, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are kept from causing interference with the signal on the core.
%
%In order to measure VSWR in coax cables we use a slotted coax cable with a probe that can measure the electric field inside the dielectric. The probe is connected to a radio detector which converts electromagnetic waves to a voltage that we can read on a voltmeter. We connect one end of the cable to a signal generator set at 3GHz and leave the other end open. Since the impedance inside the cable (50½) does not match the impedance of free space (infinite), the power will be reflected and we should expect to see standing waves. %\autoref{fig:cabledata} shows the measurements of the nulls and zeros.
%
%
%Taking a simple average of the values between zeros gives us a $\lambda /2$ of 50.1mm. However, using a least squares method (as described below), I find that the wave has a $\lambda /2$ of 49.8515mm. Therefore the wavelength is .0997 m. Using the formula $\lambda\upsilon = c$, that gives a velocity of $.0997  \times 3e9 =  2.991e8\: m/s$ through the coaxial cable, which is roughly the speed of light as we would expect. Note that using the simple averaging method would have given a velocity just greater that the speed of light!
%
%The least squares matrix method was done in Matlab as follows:
%
% \texttt{\\
% \%input in the form of a matrix, rows contain points \\
% x=[1,520;2,1020;3,1530;4,2035;5,2535;6,3040;7,3510;8,4025;9,4505;10,5015]                    \\
% \%forming A of Ax=b \\
% a=[1,x(1,1);1,x(2,1);1,x(3,1);1,x(4,1);1,x(5,1);1,x(6,1);1,x(7,1);1,x(8,1);1,x(9,1);1,x(10,1)]           \\
% \%forming b of Ax=b \\
% b=[x(1,2);x(2,2);x(3,2);x(4,2);x(5,2);x(6,2);x(7,2);x(8,2);x(9,2);x(10,2)]                \\
% \%computing projection of matrix A on b, giving x \\
% yy=inv(transpose(a)*a)*transpose(a)*b }
%
%
%
%When the coax cable is terminated with a matched load, the wave is not reflected and therefore there is roughly no standing wave in the cable.
%
%
%
%\subsection{Standing Waves in X-Band Waveguide}

%But wait, one might say- the velocities calculated above are fast than the speed of light! This becomes less puzzling when we realize that what we are actually measuring is the 'phase velocity' given by $\upsilon_{p} = \frac{c}{sin \theta}$. Just like waves in the ocean, because a line of constant phase is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is traveling, the phase velocity along the 'beach' is faster than 3e8.

%Finally, we are able to derive the cutoff wavelength of this particular waveguide by extrapolating from the data we measured. We already know that the cutoff frequency s 7GHz, and as seen in \autoref{fig:wv}, the line of best fit extended back to 7GHZ gives us a wavelength of approximately 9cm.

%\section{Conclusion}
%In this lab we found the shape of the 21-cm line from atomic Hydrogen in our galaxy and calibrated the results to remove the instrumental contribution to the spectrum. In the second part of the lab we learned about reflections and impedance matching, VSWR, and how to derive cable lengths and propagation velocities by measuring reflections and wavelengths in both coax cables and waveguides. Lastly, we used linear least-squares fitting to get the most accurate results from our data.
